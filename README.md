# importance of indices: 
Problem Statement:
The execution of complex queries in database system with large data will be overhead in terms of performance issues. The main performance issues will be the execution speed and time taken to execute a complex query.
Tentative Solution:
This type of performance issues in the real time databases can be overcome by using indices concept. Ordered Indices help us to improve the performance of system in terms of speed and time. In our scenario we will use joins and filters to implement the complex query, usage of Non-clustered indices helps to improve the performance cost.
